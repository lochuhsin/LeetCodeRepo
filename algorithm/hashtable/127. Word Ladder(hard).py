Run bfs by using hashmap to contain possible states

First generate every state that the word can possible be converted,
Example: fox -> *ox , f*x, fo* (the problems tells that change one alphabet a time.)

Now, this problem can be view as a graph,
fox has a meta state *ox, f*x, fo* that can be convert to -> dox, fig, fog .......etc

Therefore we create a dictionary to be viewed as 2D-graph.
For every word in wordList will be put into a meta state that might or could be convert to.

Ex: dog
['*og'] = [dog]
['d*g'] = [dog]
['do*'] = [dog]

so as dig
['*ig'] = [dig]
['d*g'] = [dog, dig]  # noticed here that if a word can be convert to d*g this meta state,
                        it is able to convert to both dog and dig.
['di*'] = [dig]

combination_dic = {}
for everyword in wordList:
    put all possible state into the above dic

now run bfs, start = queue([start word])
